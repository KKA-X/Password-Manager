# Password Manager

A **secure and user-friendly Password Manager** designed to help individuals store and manage their passwords offline. Built with Python, tkinter, and cryptography, this mini-project focuses on providing a reliable solution for password management without internet dependency.

## Features

- **Offline Application:** Ensures data security by operating independently of internet connectivity.
- **Secure Storage:** Encrypts passwords using advanced cryptographic techniques (e.g., RSA).
- **Master Password:** Protects access to all stored passwords with a master password.
- **Password Management:** Add, update, delete, and search for saved passwords.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Aesthetic dark-themed GUI designed with `customtkinter`.
- **Password Strength Indicator:** Helps users choose strong passwords.
- **Data Encryption:** Uses RSA encryption for storing sensitive data.
- **Error Handling:** Robust mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and operations.
